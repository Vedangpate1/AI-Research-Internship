Neural Voting Field for 3D Human Pose Estimation
Under the guidance of Dr. Junsong Yuan (University at Buffalo)

NVF introduces a unified framework for precise root relative 3D Human pose estimation from a single RGB image, employing a 3D implicit representation. In contrast to previous methods that employ holistic or dense pixel-level regression techniques for relative 3D hand pose estimation, followed by intricate post-processing for global root or scale recovery, it proposes a novel and streamlined approach. The Neural Voting Field (NVF) adopts a unified 3D dense regression scheme for the estimation of camera-space 3D human pose.
